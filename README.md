#### Hello!

#### You've navigated yourself all the way to the README!

#### That's great to hear.
# About
This game, of which is currently untitled and dubbed "Project Aloe-Vera", is a top-down\
adventure, sandbox game. It features ASCII characters to represent everything this game\
has to offer. Project Aloe-Vera is a procedurally generated game that theoretically has\
an infinite world size. This allows for maximum creativity and replayability.


# Installation
To install this game as is, which is the test build as of 7/16/2020, you must:

- Have Python 3.8 installed
- Have a working Python environment (i.e. JetBrains PyCharm)
- Put all given files into one folder

Once all this is done, you can safely run the 'hamburg.py' file as a Python script.

# Controls
This game is somewhat text-based so the input is a little strange. After every\
input you must hit enter to submit/confirm your input:

- There are regular WASD controls for the player (█).
- To break the trees (↑), use IJKL, directionally.
- To place wood (|), use TFGH, directionally.

These controls seem strange at first but become second nature the more you use them.
# WARNING
## THIS GAME IS VERY WIP, 
That being said, please report any bugs you might find throughout playing.

#### Thank you, and enjoy!
